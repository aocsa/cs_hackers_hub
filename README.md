# Coding Interview: Algorithms and Data Structures

In this course you will learn data structures and algorithms by solving practice problems. You will begin each course by learning to solve defined problems related to a particular data structure and algorithm. By the end of each course, you would be able to evaluate and assess different data structures and algorithms for any open-ended problem and implement a solution based on your design choices. 

An algorithms is, essentially, a well-defined set of rules or instructions that allow solving a computational problem. The theoretical study of the performance of the algorithms and the resources used by them, usually time and space, allows us to evaluate if an algorithm is suitable for solving a specific problem, comparing it with other algorithms for the same problem or even delimiting the boundary between viable and impossible.
